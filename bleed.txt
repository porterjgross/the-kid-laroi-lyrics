How did your heart mend so easy?
Mine still bleeds (Ooh-ooh)
Hard to believe you don't need me
All those memories we made are burnin' in my brain
And I'm stuck in yesterday, for me it's still the same
Tell me how (Ooh-ooh)
How did your heart mend so easy?
Mine still bleeds

The ghost of you still floats around my room
It lets me know that letting go's just not the same with you
Now every night I lay here in this bed we made for two
But I'm sleepin' alone while you're out there with somebody in there
So I hope that he cares
In the way that I did, you abandoned me here
Lost up in my head again, I'm caught inside myself
You promised that it wouldn't end

But you let me, you let me down

How did your heart mend so easy?
Mine still bleeds (Ooh-ooh)
Hard to believe you don't need me
All those memories we made are burnin' in my brain (Memories we made are burnin' in my brain and I'm stuck in yesterday)
And I'm stuck in yesterday, for me it's still the same
Tell me how (Ooh-ooh)
How did your heart mend so easy?
Mine still bleeds

Don't give up just because it's hard
Come back and heal me before I'm left scarred
You tell me we took this too far
As soon as I let down my guard

When you needed it most, as you cried, I was soaked
Now it's weeks since we spoke, had your mom drop my clothes
And she tried to console me, the love comes and goes
And there's nothing you owe me

But you let me, you let me down

How did your heart mend so easy?
Mine still bleeds (Ooh-ooh)
Hard to believe you don't need me
All those memories we made are burnin' in my brain (Memories we made are burnin' in my brain and I'm stuck in yesterday)
And I'm stuck in yesterday, for me it's still the same
Tell me how (Ooh-ooh)
How did your heart mend so easy?
Mine still bleeds
