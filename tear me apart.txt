I'm sorry for the pain I've caused
Sorry, it's just all my flaws
I'll go now
So we'll be fine in the next life and beyond
I don't wanna hurt you more
I'm high as hell, and my heart is torn
'Cause I don't know if I can wait for the next life

So cut me off, I hang by a thread
'Cause when one thought's gone, it's replaced by the next
Got one foot up, but I'm so scared, oh, I, I, I'mâ€”
It's a pointless debate, but who's to blame?
We distract ourselves, but my feelings changed
And that old flame that we once had faded out

I'm sorry for the pain I've caused
Sorry for the problems I've brought
I know that it's not your fault
But it's eatin' me alive and tearin' me apart
Sharp aches, cryin' into space
A year's worth emotions in days
Why's everyone around me strange?
And why the hell I gotta feel this strain?

So cut me off, I hang by a thread
'Cause when one thought's gone, it's replaced by the next
Got one foot off, but I'm so scared, oh, I, I, I'm
It's a pointless debate, but who's to blame?
We distract ourselves, but my feelings changed
And that old flame that we once had faded out

So I'm, I'm never gonna look back, uh, uh
Never gonna look back, so
I'm never gonna do it to you again (Ah, ah, ah, ah)
Never gonna look back, never gonna do that
'Cause I'm never gonna look back
I'm tired of feelin' like I should hate myself
Left my body and took my soul
But when it's gone, where does it go?
