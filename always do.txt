Said I wouldn't drink, but I did the same day
Shit, I lied to your face like I always do
Said I was gon' change, both knew that I can't
Shit, I'd rather take the blame like I always do
I been the same ever since the first day
Now you actin' surprised, but bitch, you always knew
Maybe it's time for me to find somebody else
Like I always do

I know you can't believe me 'cause I never tell the truth but, oh
I wish that you could just see that it was only to protect you, no
How many times can somebody want the same thing? (Pain, pain)
When the pressure put on me, yeah, I change things
And every time that I run, I know you gon' chase
We always end up right back in the same place

You-u-u-u-u, wasted all my time with you-u-u-u-u
Wishin' I was someone new-ew-ew-ew-ew
Stuck up in my ways and
You say that you hate it, but you always knew

Said I wouldn't drink, but I did the same day
Shit, I lied to your face like I always do
Said I was gon' change, both knew that I can't
Shit, I'd rather take the blame like I always do
I been the same ever since the first day
Now you actin' surprised, but bitch, you always knew
Maybe it's time for me to find somebody else
Like I always do

Do, do, do, do, do, like I always do
Do, do, do, do, do, like I always do

Oh, I'm sorry, I can't be the me you wanted
I'm about to fall in your robbery
I'm not the one to solve your problems (No, no)
'Cause I'm fucked up too-oo-oo-oo-oo

Wasted all my time with you-u-u-u-u
Wishin' I was someone new-ew-ew-ew-ew
Stuck up in my ways and
You say that you hate it, but you always knew

Said I wouldn't drink, but I did the same day
Shit, I lied to your face like I always do
Said I was gon' change, both knew that I can't
Shit, I'd rather take the blame like I always do
I've been the same ever since the first day
Now you actin' surprised, but bitch, you always knew
Maybe it's time for me to find somebody else
Like I always do

Do, do, do, do, do, like I always do
Do, do, do, do, do, like I always do
