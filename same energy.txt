ou say you got it all figured out, oh well, I'd like to disagree
I don't think that you understand what you meant to me
I'm somewhere doing better, all you are is a memory
You said we're enemies, well, keep that energy
I'm somewhere doing better, getting high right now
I can't believe I ever let you in my life right now
Pour a cup, mix it up to ease my mind right now
Fuck love, I got money on my mind right now, oh

I can't believe I used to cry about you (Oh)
I'm doing so much better in my life without you
Bitch, you're the past, I'ma leave your ass behind, without you (Bye-bye)
My new bitch better than my last, I vouched too
I promise, know I got it, she won't stop callin'
Ballin', something like Jordan, unless she all in
I'm mobbin' deep with these hoes, R.I.P. to Prodigy
Poppin', she know I'm poppin', she put it all on me
