"So cold," that's what you call me
Call your phone when I get lonely, yeah
Tonight, you told me that you miss the old me
After I hit it, I did not want you to hold me, no

You asking me, "What is the issue?"
Callin' my Uber 'cause I don't wanna be with you
Trust me when I tell you this ain't nothing against you
I got some problems that I don't wanna get into

I just fucked another bitch thinkin' about you
Can't even lie, all the time, I think about you
Lot of other bitches probably gon' think this about them
But girl, this is about you, girl, you know this
I just fucked another bitch thinkin' about you
Can't even lie, all the time, I think about you
Lot of other bitches probably gon' think this about them
But girl, this is about you, girl, you know this

I hate to admit it, but I think I caught some feelings for you
Still fuckin' the same hoes, but none give me that feelin' from you
It's like I be with them, but I can't help but think 'bout you
I'd rather be with you, but I can't put myself through that
Huh, again
I trusted a bitch once, I cannot do that again
But what if you're the one? I'd mess it up, then lose out again
I don't want to see you leave, I'm refusing, I am, oh, yeah

You asking me, "What is the issue?"
Callin' my Uber 'cause I don't wanna be with you
Trust me when I tell you this ain't nothing against you
I got some problems that I don't wanna get into

I just fucked another bitch thinkin' about you
Can't even lie, all the time, I think about you
Lot of other bitches probably gon' think this about them
But girl, this is about you, girl, you know this
I just fucked another bitch thinkin' about you
Can't even lie, all the time, I think about you
Lot of other bitches probably gon' think this about them
But girl, this is about you, girl, you know this
